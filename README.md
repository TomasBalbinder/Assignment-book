This web application serves as a task manager for both computers and mobile devices. It enables easy task management using color-coded cards that can be marked by priority. With a simple interface, tasks can be quickly added or removed, and all changes are instantly synchronized across devices. This web application is ideal for anyone who needs to efficiently organize their tasks and have them at their fingertips.




How to download a repository. Here are a few ways to do it.

If you want to use my web application and maybe extend it or modify it in any way, you can.

I installed additional libraries using the pip package manager. It's very simple.

https://pypi.org/

I created a file and with the following command, you can easily install everything:

pip install -r requirements.txt

You will need at least Python 3.0 or later to install these packages. I used Python version 3.8.1.
